Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project:

1. Domain specific language for music notation, OR Parsing source code (of some programming language) into an AST for music notation, effectively generating music from an arbitrary progarm (and maybe use a music library to play it)

2. Programming language with (strict) natural-language like syntax, so code reads like English, OR a different human language version of an existing programming language, for example Chinese java that has Chinese keywords, but parses to standard java

3. Static analysis for interesting features of Rust (possibly syntax highlighting, either from scratch or adding onto an existing onpen-source syntax highlighting) or Prolog
