The tex files can be successfully compiled and translated into a pdf file using TeXShop (version 3.88).

I have separated each section to different tex files so people can edit their own section and commit with less chance having merge conflicts.

Update: Fromf Joanne's feedback, here is something we need to care about when editing Latex files.
- the encoding I choose is utf-8
- try not to use abbreviation, e.g. use "it is" instead of "it's", "are not" instead of "aren't"
