\section{Introduction}

Music is one of the most beautiful and most ancient languages humans have ever created. With the help of advanced technology, many solutions have been designed to facilitate the creation and spread process of music. ABC is one of the most widely used music notation languages among them. Even though it has a lot of great features to help musicians to generate formal music sheets from scratch, but its nature of being a markup language has limited its capability of efficient modification.

Our group plan to design a domain specific language with the key features of any scripting languages, hoping to help users modify their ABC files more conveniently and efficiently. This proposal will elaborate on how it will fulfill the project requirement and specific steps to achieve our goal.
