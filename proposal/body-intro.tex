\section{Introduction}

Music is one of the most beautiful and ancient languages humans have created. With the advancement of technology, many solutions have been designed to facilitate the creation and spread process of music. ABC is one of the most widely used music notation forms. Even though it has great features to help musicians generate formal music sheets from scratch, its nature of being a markup language has limited its capacity for effective modification.

Our group plans to design a domain specific language called ABCD that extends ABC with variables, functions, conditionals and loops. Our goal is to allow users to modify an existing ABC file or create a new piece by writing scripts in ABCD that compiles to ABC. This proposal will elaborate on how it will fulfill the project requirement and what steps we would take to achieve the goal.
