\section{Introduction}

Music is one of the most beautiful and ancient language humans have created. With the advancement of technology, many solutions have been designed to facilitate the creation and spread process of music. ABC is one of the most widely used music notation form. Even though it has great features to help musicians generate formal music sheets from scratch, its nature of being a markup language has limited its capacity for effective modification.

Our group plans to design a domain specific language with features of a scripting language, including variables, functions, conditionals and loops. Our goal is to help users modify their ABC files more conveniently and efficiently. This proposal will elaborate on how it will fulfill the project requirement and what steps we would take to achieve the goal.
