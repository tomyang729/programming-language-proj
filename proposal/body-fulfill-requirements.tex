\section{How it fulfills the project type requirements}

The purpose of our project fits into the fifth project type. We will design a DSL (Domain Specific Language) called ABCD which empowers users to edit and modify music sheets written in ABC music notation more effectively and efficiently. The users of ABCD will be professionals who use ABC to write their music. ABCD could help users in many ways, and some general user cases are listed below:
	- A trumpet player may want a program that transposes songs for C instruments to scores for B flat 	instruments
	- A composer writing a score in ABC may wish to change the key of the last x bars of their song
	- An arranger may wish to add a harmony to every instance of a certain note
	- A producer may wish to generate part of a song or a whole song programmatically
All of these can be easily accomplished as programs written in ABCD. ABC alone is not powerful enough to do these programmatically -- it would have to be done manually. An alternative solution would be using another programming language, but  extra efforts on parsing and compiling ABC would be required, whereas ABCD would support those natively.
