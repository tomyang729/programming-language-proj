\section{How it fulfills the project type requirements}

there needs to be some person (your user, who cannot just be you) who might realistically want to use your 100\% level to solve problems in their domain over the existing choices available
Ex a trumpet player may want a program that transposes songs for C instruments to scores for B flat instruments
A composer writing a score in ABC may wish to change the key of the last x bars of their song
An arranger may wish to add a harmony to every instance of a certain note
A producer may wish to generate part of a song or a whole song programmatically
All of these can be accomplished as programs written in ABCD. ABC alone is not powerful enough to do these programmatically (CONFIRM THIS) -- it would have to be done manually. This could be done using another programming language, but  ABC parsing and writing would need to be implemented, where ABCD would support those natively.
