\section{Approach to get to 80\% milestone}
The 80\% mileston

\subsection{Phase 1: Get familiar with ABC notation}
Time: Oct 27 - Oct 31
Familiarize ourselves with ABC notations features, read through the abc notation website. Each team member write 2 small music pieces(can be very short) using the existing ABC notation and play them on the project meeting. Discuss our own music-writing experience and document it on a google doc.

\subsection{Phase 2: Read the full ABC language specification}
Time: Nov 1 - Nov 5
\url{http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.2}
Read through the full ABC language specification, note our discoveries. Decide which parts can be used directly or after some modification in our ABCD language specification, and document these in our ABCD specification. The result of this phase will be a pdf file that lists all the borrowed specifications from ABC.

\subsection{Phase 3: Criticize ABC and develop a draft ABCD}
Time: Nov 6 - Nov 9
Read discussions on stackexchange to see people's opinion and suggestion on ABC. List ABC's advantages and disadvantages to prove why we need to develop ABCD. The result of this phase will be our background research report.
